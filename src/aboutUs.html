                    <li>President, Founder</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Dennis Donato Agalli is a Miami-based hospitality owner and operator and real estate
                      professional. He has more than a decade of experience that has led to his current initiative:
                      creating affordable housing solutions for American families.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Born in Europe, Agalli grew up in New York, after he graduated from Stivers High School of the
                      Arts in Dayton, Ohio. Agalli's educational background includes Manhattan College in Riverdale,
                      NY where he earned a BBA in Finance and a minor in Economics.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Agalli's 2022 vision is creating affordable housing. Miamians struggling with high rents need
                      access to solutions that keep them in their homes. Through the National Affordable Housing
                      Association, Agalli is creating real estate solutions that help low income families and their
                      children avoid displacement as rents rise.</li>
